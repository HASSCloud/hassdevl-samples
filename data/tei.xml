 [Reel 16]<lb/>
 [January 16 Tuesday 1855]<lb/>
 Purchased this Diary for which I paid 10/ and considered reasonable, it being but 50<lb/>
 per Cent over the Home Cost.<lb/>
 Went to the Main Gaol to hear tidings of the State Prisoners, charged with<lb/>
 Treason in taking up arms against the Government at Balaarat. The Judge remanded<lb/>
 them for 10 days, stating that being charged with High Treason, they were entitled to<lb/>
 that term of clear notice with copies of their indictments from the opening of the<lb/>
 Sessions. Mr Ireland the Counsel for the Defence, stated he was prepared to proceed<lb/>
 at once, but the Chief Justice preferred granting the priviledge (sic) allowed by the<lb/>
 Law.<lb/>
 This conduct seems evidently to betray an inclination on the part of the<lb/>
 Governt. to let the matter gradually drop, and in my opinion the men will not be tried<lb/>
 at all.<lb/>
 There is a great deal of excitement in the Town, and the Gaol Authorities<lb/>
 fearing violence have barricaded and strengthened the Entrance, as well as made a<lb/>
 door as close to the Court as possible by which to take the prisoners too (sic) and<lb/>
 from Trial. I remarked that people might break doors to get out, but that I hardly<lb/>
 thought they would break them to get into the prison.<lb/>
 The Visiting Magistrate inspected the Gaol today. I wrote a letter to my sister<lb/>
 at Geelong, enclosing one from our Father to her.

 Forwarded Letter to the Sheriff suggesting the propriety of getting William Biggen<lb/>
 into the Benevolent Asylum.<lb/>
 A very heavy fall of rain attended with thunder and lighting.<lb/>
 It is no wonder that the Good men of this town should earnestly strive to<lb/>
 conquer drunkenness when a moment’s reflection makes the mischief caused by it so<lb/>
 hideously palpable. Scarce a day passes but I have some poor wretch or other brought<lb/>
 me suffering from the "Horrors" or Delirium Tremens. The fancies of these men are<lb/>
 sometimes Horrible, one to day (a wealthy Digger too for the Police have deposited<lb/>
 with me value of more than a £100 Sterling) believes the whole town to be in<lb/>
 conspiracy to poison him, and in consequence grew so frightened that he gave himself<lb/>
 up to the Police for Protection.<lb/>
 I called this evening to see Lotherington, and heard from him that Emma had<lb/>
 been in town and caught in the rain had too (sic) stop 2 hours in the Arcade. It makes<lb/>
 me happy to notice how proud and how kind too Joe is to Emma. I met with Mr<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP860P1' xml:id='OTP860P1'> My life is proceeding most unsatisfactory each day more wearisome than the preceding. Each day commenced with the lassitude caused by the last night's debauch, Each day fresh resolutions of reformation made, each day such resolutions broken on the first temptation.  I am not a Drunkard, I hate Blackguard Society. I long for genial friendship, and to find one woman, that I could love and respect, Wanting these, and also not having strength  of mind to study, nor a refuge in my own thoughts, After the days confinement I am open to the calls of the First Idler, Lounge about, Drink, Look at the whores, fool away my money at their homes, by paying for drink which is neither wanted, nor drank, at prices four times as high as even the extravagant charges obtained by Publicans &amp; all for what, to be called a Good natured fool, and upon reflection, to be disgusted with self &amp; mankind.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP860P2' xml:id='OTP860P2'> Called upon Lotherington. Emma Quite well. Invited to St Kilda but refused weather appearing unfavourable.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP860P3' xml:id='OTP860P3'> Mr Matyr called in the Evening. I went out with him and into several disreputable Houses, Monk’s, By Maria's, Woman previously unknown but, possessing Trap for Grog, Babies, Absent Lodger and absent husband of mysterious pursuits.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP861P1' xml:id='OTP861P1'> Went to the Main Gaol the first thing this morning. Mr Wintle remarkably uncommunicative<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP861P2' xml:id='OTP861P2'> The Gaol is getting very crowded and difficult to manage, noisy lunatics, Stubborn Half Fools, Helpless idiots, and uncompromising Turnkeys, require exertion and tact to keep out of hot water.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP861P3' xml:id='OTP861P3'> Messrs McNee &amp; Newby called after four o clock went out with them and eventually dined at Dr Stillman's. Spent the evening there, and got home comfortably early.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP861P5' xml:id='OTP861P5'> There is one month of 1855 passed and I cannot congratulate myself upon having at all bettered my conditions or prospects.  I have spent tis true no more than my salary, but then of that salary I have wasted nearly the half. I have drank a great deal more than necessary, have made undesirable acquaintance, have enabled the people about me to have the power of talking of my keeping late hours and have left no sunny remembrance, that I may fall back upon God strengthen and assist me so that I may spend February more desirably.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP861P6' xml:id='OTP861P6'> Madras Steamer sailed to day taking home Sir Charles Fitzroy late Governor General of Sydney. I sent Newspapers by her but no letters.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP862P1' xml:id='OTP862P1'> Got up early noticed some irregularity of the Old Doctor's so sat down and drew out some regulations, which I posted to prevent any future plea of ignorance.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP862P2' xml:id='OTP862P2'> A prisoner wrote to the Sheriff. Mr Wintle brought up the answer.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP862P3' xml:id='OTP862P3'> The Presbyterian Minister addressed the Protestants.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP862P5' xml:id='OTP862P5'> Went down after muster and called on McEwen, he took me to see Lewis the Colonial Dispenser.  Mrs Lewis and her female companion are not all my style. Took Tea with Mrs McEwen and then she, I and Lewis went for ramble. Brought them home, had some Grog and left them eventually very talkative.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP862P6' xml:id='OTP862P6'> Mrs Lewis has a baby and that baby will she says be twelve months old to morrow.  So I am invited there to dine. It is really a great Bore, but as I escaped some [previous?] festivity by pleading indisposition I think I must go.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP862P7' xml:id='OTP862P7'> Women are deceitful wretches. When we called upon Mrs Lewis, We were told that Joseph would not kill the duck. It would not take him a moment to cut its throat says Mrs Lewis, or chop its head off with an axe sang her companion.  McEwen gallantly undertook the butchery, and when all was over and the duck suspended in the Larder, the women began to talk sentiment. What a pity it was to kill the poor thing. It was such a pretty creature, I should so like to have kept it.<lb/>

</p>

<p corresp='TTP862P8' xml:id='OTP862P8'> Thank God I am single.<lb/>
