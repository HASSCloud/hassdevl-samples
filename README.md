# HASS DEVL Sample Notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/stevecassidy/hassdevl-samples.git/master)

This repository contains sample notebooks from the [Humanities and Social Sciences Data 
Enhanced Virtual Laboratory](https://hasscloud.net.au/) (HASS DEVL) project funded by 
[ARDC](https://nectar.org.au/).  

Some services used in these notebooks require secret API keys or usernames.  The scripts read these
from a file `secret.json` in this directory.   To get the scripts to work, copy the file `secret.json.dist` 
to `secret.json` and edit it to add your keys.
